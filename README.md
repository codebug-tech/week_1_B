# RECIPE WEBSITE
[TERMINAL help](https://github.com/codebug-tech/week-1-A)

#### Your mission is create a webpage for your favorite recipe.
1. Find a recipe you would like to use.
2. Via the terminal, create a new folder on your desktop called `coding`.
3. `cd` into your `coding` folder and create two files `recipe.html` and `style.css`.
4. Use the `subl` command to open both files in Sublime. 
5. Click on the `recipe.html` file, type `html` in the file and hit `tab`. 
    * If that didn't autofill html for you, copy and paste this into your html file: 
        ```
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
            <head>
              <title></title>
            </head>
            <body>
            </body>
          </html>
        ```
6. Now we need to link our CSS file. If you've forgotten how to do that, use
