# RECIPE WEBSITE
[TERMINAL HELP](https://github.com/codebug-tech/week-1-A)

#### Your mission is create a webpage for your favorite recipe.
1. Find a recipe you would like to use.
2. Via the terminal, create a new folder on your desktop called `coding`.
3. `cd` into your `coding` folder and create a `recipe.html` file.
4. Use the `subl` command to open the file in Sublime. 
5. Click on the `recipe.html` file, type `html` in the file, and hit `tab`. 
    * If that didn't autofill html for you, copy and paste this into your html file: 
    ``` HTML
      <!DOCTYPE html>     
      <html>
         <head>
           <title></title>
         </head>
         <body>
         </body>
      </html>
    ```
6. Add a title for your page in the `title` html element with the name of your recipe. 
7. Use `open recipe.html` from your terminal to see your file in your web browser!

# THE CODE
> Don't worry if your recipe site doesn't look great, you'll be adding the styling later. 

Your recipe page must include the following:

* A header with the name of the dish.
* A paragraph explaining some fun facts about the dish.
* A picture of the final product. Or many pictures if you'd like!
* An unordered list of ingredients.
* An ordered list of directions.
* Links to 3 other suggested recipes.
* A table of nutritional facts (You can make these up if you would like to!) 

> *Look at the [nutritional-facts](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/italian-sausage-lasagna/2601a67c-438d-407a-b163-2f57ede06cb9) on this recipe if you need inspiration* 

#### EXTENSION

* Create a form that allows people to write a review of the recipe. 
* Begin styling your website!

    * Note: You'll need to create a `style.css` page for your CSS styling.
    * We need to link our CSS file to our HTML file. If you've forgotten how to do that, follow this [link](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/htmlcss-linking).

> *HINT!!! you will be using `<form method="post">` & Google is your friend*
